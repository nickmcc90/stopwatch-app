<!--Figure out how to take update numbers to say zero after clear button in timer select-->

<!--First, putting the timer start button into place on the web page.
Next, making it appear only after we set a timer. DONE
Then, making it flip on and off from showing start and stop when clicked. DONE
Then, making the reset button take care of resetting it. (maybe it already does.) DONE
Then, grabbing the numbers spaces off the main page and having them change when we press the button. DONE
Finally, having the timer start button disappear when we press reset or the timer finishes.

<!--We are in the middle of working on the timer algorithm function.-->


<!-- This is my first Javascript project! I stopped working on it 2/23/24. I was only
supposed to make a stopwatch, but I tried to implement a timer as well. That works well,
but there are some bugs because if you do something wacky like start the stopwatch 
to start counting up, then set a timer and make it count down. Both the stopwatch
and timer make the values of the clock bug out. This is probably easily fixable,
but I just spent the last few days fixing some bugs and I'm honestly tired of this
project. I learned a lot about debugging things, as well as implementing the JS I learned
as well as html and css. Maybe I'll come back to this project and add the secret layouts I've
wanted to add. I added another comment under this one which details my findings with a 
bug I was trying to fix, but it worked itself out miraculously.-->


<!-- Crazy thing with hitting reset while the timer is still counting down tidbit: We hit
reset, and the values of timerTime all equal zero, but the timerAlgorithm inside
of timerFinallyStart is still running because we never gave it the clearInterval
id. So, the timerAlgorithm runs again, with the starting values of the timer all
equalling zero. In the timerAlgorithm, when all the values equal zero, it runs
an if statement that runs the timerFinallyStart function which turns off
the setInterval and timerAlgorithm, and it runs a reset which finally 
makes all the values zero and finishes everything. This bug worked itself
out, based on the code I randomly wrote. -->
